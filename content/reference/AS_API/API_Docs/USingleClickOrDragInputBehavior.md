## Inheritance

UAnyButtonInputBehavior → USingleClickOrDragInputBehavior

## Description

USingleClickOrDragInputBehavior is a combination of a USingleClickBehavior and UClickDragBehavior, and allows for the common UI interaction where a click-and-release does one action, but if the mouse is moved, then a drag interaction is started. For example click-to-select is often combined with a drag-marquee-rectangle in this way. This can be directly implemented with a UClickDragBehavior but requires the client to (eg) detect movement thresholds, etc. This class encapsulates all that state/logic.

The .ClickDistanceThreshold parameter determines how far the mouse must move (in whatever device units are in use) to switch from a click to drag interaction

The .bBeginDragIfClickTargetNotHit parameter determines if the drag interaction will be immediately initiated if the initial 'click' mouse-down does not hit a valid clickable target. Defaults to true.

The hit-test and on-clicked functions are provided by a IClickBehaviorTarget instance, while an IClickDragBehaviorTarget provides the can-click-drag/begin-drag/update-drag/end-drag functionality.
