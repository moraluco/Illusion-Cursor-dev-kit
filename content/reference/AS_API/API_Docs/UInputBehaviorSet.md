# UInputBehaviorSet

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UObject → UInputBehaviorSet

## Description

UInputBehaviorSet manages a set of UInputBehaviors, and provides various functions to query and forward events to the set. Tools and Widgets provide instances of this via IInputBehaviorSource, and UInputRouter collects and manages them (see comments there)

Behaviors in the set each have a source pointer and group tag, which allows sets of behaviors to be managed together. For example one UInputBehaviorSet can be merged into another and removed later.
