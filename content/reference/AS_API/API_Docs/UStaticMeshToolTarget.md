## Description

A tool target backed by a static mesh asset that can provide and take a mesh description.

This is a special tool target that refers to the underlying asset (in this case a static mesh), rather than indirectly through a component.  This type of target is used in cases, such as opening an asset through the content browser, when there is no component available.
