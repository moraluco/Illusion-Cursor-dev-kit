# UTransformProxy

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UObject → UTransformProxy

## Description

UTransformProxy is used to transform a set of sub-ojects. An internal FTransform is generated based on the sub-object set, and the relative FTransform of each sub-object is stored. Then as this main transform is updated, the sub-objects are also updated.

Currently only USceneComponent sub-objects are supported.

If only one sub-object is set, the main transform is the sub-object transform.  Otherwise the main transform is centered at the average origin and has no rotation.
