## Description

UEditorInteractiveToolsContext is an extension/adapter of an InteractiveToolsContext designed for use in the UE Editor. Currently this implementation assumes that it is created by a Mode Manager (FEditorModeTools), and that the Mode Manager will call various API functions like Render() and Tick() when necessary.

allows it to be easily embedded inside an FEdMode. A set of functions are provided which can be called from the FEdMode functions of the same name. These will handle the data type conversions and forwarding calls necessary to operate the ToolsContext
