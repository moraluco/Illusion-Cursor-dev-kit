# URectangleMarqueeMechanic

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UInteractionMechanic → URectangleMarqueeMechanic

## Description

Mechanic for a rectangle "marquee" selection. It creates and maintains the 2D rectangle associated with a mouse drag.  It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.

When using this mechanic, you should call Render() on it in the tool's Render() call so that it can cache necessary camera state, and DrawHUD() in the tool's DrawHUD() call so that it can draw the box.

Attach to the mechanic's delegates and use the passed rectangle to test against your geometry.
