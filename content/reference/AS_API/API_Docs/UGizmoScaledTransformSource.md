# UGizmoScaledTransformSource

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UGizmoBaseTransformSource → UGizmoScaledTransformSource

## Description

@deprecated Use UGizmoScaledAndUnscaledTransformSources instead.

Old description: UGizmoScaledTransformSource wraps another IGizmoTransformSource implementation and adds a separate scaling vector to the Transform. The main use of this class is to support scaling in a 3D gizmo without actually scaling the Gizmo itself. Generally our pattern is to apply the gizmo's position/rotation transform to the target object via a TransformProxy, but that does not work with Scaling. So this class stores the scaling vector separately, provided by an external source via FSeparateScaleProvider, and in GetTransform/SetTransform rewrites the Transform from the child IGizmoTransformSource with the new scale.
