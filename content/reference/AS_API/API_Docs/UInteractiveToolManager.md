# UInteractiveToolManager

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UObject → UInteractiveToolManager

## Description

UInteractiveToolManager allows users of the tools framework to create and operate Tool instances.  For each Tool, a (string,ToolBuilder) pair is registered with the ToolManager.  Tools can then be activated via the string identifier.

Currently a single Tool can be active for each input device. So for mouse input a single Tool is available and effectively a lightweight mode. The mouse uses the "Left" tool slot.

For VR controllers and touch input, a "Left" and "Right" tool can be active at the same time.  @todo this is not fully supported yet

Tools are not directly created. Use SelectActiveToolType(side,string) to set the active ToolBuilder on a given side, and then use ActivateTool() to create the new Tool instance.
