## Description

Mechanic for a PolyLasso "marquee" selection. It creates and maintains the 2D PolyLasso associated with a mouse drag.  It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.

The PolyLasso has two potential modes, a freehand polyline and a multi-click polygon. By default both are enabled but this can be selectively controlled with flags below. If a click-and-release is within a small distance tolerance, then a multi-click polygon is entered, and must be exited by clicking again at the start point. The freehand polyline is drawn by click-dragging, and exited by releasing the mouse.

When using this mechanic, you should call DrawHUD() in the tool's DrawHUD() call so that it can draw the box.

Attach to the mechanic's delegates and use the passed PolyLasso to test against your geometry.
