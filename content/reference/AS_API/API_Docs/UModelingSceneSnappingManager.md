# UModelingSceneSnappingManager

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

USceneSnappingManager → UModelingSceneSnappingManager

## Description

UModelingSceneSnappingManager is an implementation of snapping suitable for use in Modeling Tools/Gizmos (and potentially other places).

### Currently Supports

```
Currently Supports
```

snap to position/rotation grid

### snap to mesh vertex position

```
snap to mesh vertex position
```

snap to mesh edge position

### Snapping to mesh vertex/edge positions currently works for Volume

```
Snapping to mesh vertex/edge positions currently works for Volume(BrushComponent), StaticMeshComponent, and DynamicMeshComponent.
```

Currently the StaticMesh vertex/edge snapping is dependent on the Physics system, and may fail or return nonsense results in some cases, due to the physics complex-collision mesh deviating from the source-model mesh.

### STATIC FUNCTIONS

```
STATIC FUNCTIONS StaticClass static UClass UModelingSceneSnappingManager::StaticClass()
