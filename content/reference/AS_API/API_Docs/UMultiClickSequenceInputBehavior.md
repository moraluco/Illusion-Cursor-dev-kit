# UMultiClickSequenceInputBehavior

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UAnyButtonInputBehavior → UMultiClickSequenceInputBehavior

## Description

UMultiClickSequenceInputBehavior implements a generic multi-click-sequence input behavior.  For example this behavior could be used to implement a multi-click polygon-drawing interaction.

The internal state machine works as follows: 1) on input-device-button-press, check if target wants to begin sequence. If so, begin capture.  2) on button release, check if target wants to continue or terminate sequence a) if terminate, release capture b) if continue, do nothing (capture continues between presses)

The target will receive "preview" notifications (basically hover) during updates where there is not a release. This can be used to (eg) update a rubber-band selection end point

@todo it may be better to implement this as multiple captures, and use hover callbacks to do the between-capture previews. holding capture across mouse release is not ideal.
