# URectangleMarqueeManager

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UObject → URectangleMarqueeManager

## Description

Adapted from URectangleMarqueeMechanic, the mechanic for a rectangle "marquee" selection, to operate without the UInteractionMechanic framework. It creates and maintains the 2D rectangle associated with a mouse drag.  It does not test against any scene geometry, nor does it maintain any sort of list of selected objects.

You must manually call the Setup(), Render() and DrawHUD() functions.  Note these functions have been changed from the Mechanic versions to be easier to call without additional InteractiveTool machinery

Attach to the delegates and use the passed rectangle to test against your geometry.

TODO: Refactor this into a more generalized / generally usable class in RectangleMarqueeMechanic.h, and share more common code with URectangleMarqueeMechanic.
