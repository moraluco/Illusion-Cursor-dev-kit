# UDynamicMeshPool

**Visibility:** public

## Inheritance

UObject → UDynamicMeshPool

## Description

UDynamicMeshPool manages a Pool of UDynamicMesh objects. This allows the meshes to be re-used instead of being garbage-collected. This is intended to be used by Blueprints that need to do procedural geometry operations that generate temporary meshes, as these will commonly run their construction scripts many times as the user (eg) manipulates parameters, and constantly spawning new UDynamicMesh instances will result in enormous memory usage hanging around until GC runs.

Usage is to call RequestMesh() to take ownership of an available UDynamicMesh (which will allocate a new one if the pool is empty) and ReturnMesh() to return it to the pool.

ReturnAllMeshes() can be called to return all allocated meshes.

In both cases, there is nothing preventing you from still holding on to the mesh.  So, be careful.

FreeAllMeshes() calls ReturnAllMeshes() and then releases the pool's references to the allocated meshes, so they can be Garbage Collected

If you Request() more meshes than you Return(), the Pool will still be holding on to references to those meshes, and they will never be Garbage Collected (ie memory leak).  As a failsafe, if the number of allocated meshes exceeds geometry.DynamicMesh.MaxPoolSize, the Pool will release all it's references and run garbage collection on the next call to RequestMesh().  (Do not rely on this as a memory management strategy)

An alternate strategy that could be employed here is for the Pool to not hold references to meshes it has provided, only those that have been explicitly returned.  Then non-returned meshes would simply be garbage-collected, however it allows potentially a large amount of memory to be consumed until that occurs.

UDynamicMesh::Reset() is called on the object returned to the Pool, which clears the internal FDynamicMesh3 (which uses normal C++ memory management, so no garbage collection involved) So the Pool does not re-use mesh memory, only the UObject containers.
